                    SuperFoodz is an impact organization helping to eliminate hunger by working with local and global food banks, community charities, school systems and grass root organizations. SF, by both its design and utility, will provide resources to recognized charitable organizations to empower impoverished and disenfranchised groups & communities, to provide immediate wholesome nutrition, grow their own food, create and/or improve their agricultural infrastructure.  As awareness and use of the SF loyalty token increases, larger numbers of those in need will receive essential life-giving nutritional support.
